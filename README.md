# iCU
Networks Final Project


## Using this project
The full program is managed by `driver.c`. To compline and run, use the commands:
```
make
```
and 
```
./driver
```

Additionally, you must provide your own `utils.c`, which Git ignores, because it should contain both your unique user id and the code need to retrieve your BSSID. Different operating systems have different processes for finding your BSSID, and an example for a Windows machine running WSL is included in `exampleUtils.c`
